# Location and Travel

## City of Ghent/Gent, Belgium

"There's no better place to acquire and share knowledge than Ghent."

Belgium’s conference hotspot excels, both on a national and on an international level, in sectors ranging from art to agro, food, technology and biotech.  Ghent is home to various educational institutions, research centres and knowledge clusters and is simply a nice place to organise a conference: hospitable, charming, historical, sustainable and innovative.  In short, a city on a human scale.

### Safety and Stability

Ghent is well known for its open minded people and positive attitude towards diversity and inclusivity.

### Sustainability
Cities are increasingly making efforts to limit their environmental impact. In Ghent, sustainability is more than a buzzword, it is a call for action. For many years, Ghent has been committed to protecting the environment with initiatives ranging from vegetarian capital of Europe (since 2009) to the largest low-traffic pedestrian zone in Europe (since 2017). As a result, discovering Ghent on foot or by bike is an absolute must! It is a city on a human scale, easily navigable by pedestrians.
